# Simple Text-Based Roguelike using Ncurses 6.1

This is my Fullstack Academy stackathon project. At Fullstack Academy, the main programming language that we use is javascript though for this project I wanted to explore using another programming language. In this case, I decided to use C. I chose C because I have an interest in lower-level programming languages, their ability to manipulate
memory directly and generally run more efficiently or "run closer to the metal".

To explore programming in C, I attemp te create an ascii graphics, text-based videogame that will be run from the console and use the ncurses library. I chose this type of project because 1.
I personally like the aesthetic and funtional minimalism of videogames from the 70s- to the 90s that older games like Rogue, Nethack and newer games like
Dwarf Fortress or The Caves of Qud embody. The emphasis for these types game is functionality rather than appearence and the the older games especially
used the reasources that were available to them to the fullest.

This project is using ncurses 6.1
