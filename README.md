This is my Fullstack Academy stackathon project. At Fullstack Academy, the main programming language that we use is javascript.
For this project I wanted to explore using another programming language. In this case I wanted to use a programming language that I hadn't used
in a long time C or C++. I chose these languages because I have an interest in lower-level programming languages and their ability to manipulate
memory directly, generally run more efficiently and "run closer to the metal".

To explore programming in C or C++ I will be creating a ascii graphics, text-based videogame that will be run from the console. I chose this because 1.
I personally like the aesthetic and funtional minimalism of videogames from the 70s- to the 90s that older games like Rogue and news games like
Dwarf Fortress or The Caves of Qud embody. The emphasis on the game was the functionality rather than the appearence and the the older games especially
used the reasources that were available to them to the fullest.
